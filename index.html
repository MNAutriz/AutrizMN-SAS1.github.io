                    <hr> At the same time, Self and Society also highlighted the importance of self-reflection in this process. By reflecting on my experiences and the societal structures around me, I can begin to question which parts of my identity are shaped by external influences and which are authentically mine. For example, I often ask myself whether my ambitions are driven by my true passions or by societal pressures to achieve success.</hr>

                    <h3>  Learnings about SAS as a Computer Science Student </h3> 
                    <hr> As a computer science student, this class has been surprisingly relevant to my journey. In a field often perceived as purely technical, Self and Society reminded me that technology does not exist in isolation—it’s deeply tied to people, society, and ethics. Understanding myself better helps me approach my studies with greater purpose. I now think more critically about how my skills can be used to solve real-world problems and positively impact society. For example, when I work on projects, I ask myself how the systems I build will affect users and communities. This reflective mindset pushes me to go beyond just coding for functionality and instead design solutions with empathy and social responsibility.

            In reflecting on whether I have a stable sense of self or if I’m still in the process of discovering who I am, I realize it’s not a clear-cut answer. My understanding of myself feels like an ongoing journey which is a continuous process of construction and reconstruction. This is something I’ve come to appreciate more through concepts discussed in Self and Society.
            The class emphasized that the "self" is not just an isolated entity but is shaped by social interactions, cultural norms, and personal experiences. This aligns with the symbolic interactionist perspective, where meaning and identity emerge through relationships and social roles. I now see that my sense of self evolves as I encounter different environments and engage with others. For instance, my roles as a student, a worker, and someone striving for personal goals are all part of how I construct who I am. Each of these roles exposes me to expectations and values that influence my identity.
            This process of self-construction is not static; it’s fluid. There are times when I feel confident and grounded in who I am, but other moments reveal that I’m still discovering new parts of myself. It’s this balance acknowledging stability while embracing growth that makes my personal journey both challenging and meaningful.

            The process of conducting the interviews with two individuals who know me from different
            spheres of life, I sought to understand their perceptions of my character and the qualities they
            believe define me. These perspectives, coming from both a professional and personal context,
            offered meaningful insights into how I am seen and how my actions resonate with others. Their
            observations revealed a consistent theme which entails a commitment to excellence, a balanced
            approach to life, and a strong sense of integrity.
            My professor described me as a hardworking and studious individual, deeply passionate
            about artificial intelligence. He emphasized my relentless pursuit of knowledge and my dedication
            to mastering this complex field. Beyond academics, he recognized my values, integrity, and

            efforts to excel in my studies and uphold ethical standards are noticed and appreciated by those
            who guide and mentor me. On the other hand, my dormmate offered a personal perspective,
            portraying me as a well-rounded individual who enjoys a variety of physical activities, including
            volleyball, basketball, and badminton. Despite my academic focus, he observed my ability to
            balance my studies with the things I love, demonstrating versatility and resilience. He highlighted
            my enthusiasm for sports as a testament to my determination to lead a fulfilling and active lifestyle,
            showcasing the importance I place on holistic personal growth.
            These reflections illuminate how I am perceived as someone who values intellectual

            <p>Health is a holistic concept that encompasses physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being, shaping how we view ourselves and connect with others. It is not just the absence of illness but a continuous journey of balance and growth. My health manifesto reflects my commitment to nurturing all dimensions of well-being, grounded in self-awareness and acceptance.
            Central to this is how I perceive myself—embracing my identity, body image, personality, and the biological influences that shape me. Health also reflects the impact of culture and ethnicity, recognizing how traditions and experiences inform my values and aspirations. By honoring these influences, I seek to build a sense of belonging and empathy for others.
                
            Sexuality and identity development highlight the importance of authenticity and self-expression, integral to building meaningful relationships. Mental health, a cornerstone of well-being, requires resilience, mindfulness, and seeking help when necessary. Prioritizing emotional regulation and nurturing uplifting relationships are key elements of this journey.
                
            This manifesto is a pledge to align my actions and beliefs with a vision of holistic health—balancing ambition with rest, strength with vulnerability, and independence with connection. It is a declaration of growth, grounded in compassion, curiosity, and a commitment to becoming the best version of myself.
